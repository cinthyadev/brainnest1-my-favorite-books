            <li><blockquote>Above all else I began to view attention as the most important ingredient we can add if we’re to become more productive, creative, and happy—at work and at home. When we invest our limited attention intelligently and deliberately, we focus more deeply and think more clearly</blockquote></li>
            <li><blockquote>On the surface, the results can seem a bit like magic, but magic stops being magic the moment you know how it’s done. </blockquote></li>
